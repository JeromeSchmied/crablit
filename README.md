# [learnit](https://github.com/JeromeSchmied/learnit) -> some better name needed

## [anki](https://ankiweb.net), [quizlet](https://quizlet.com) and [knowt](https://knowt.com) inspired app, just right in the terminal

## how it works
- it takes a source file: .tsv, .csv or .txt. See [examples](https://github.com/JeromeSchmied/learnit/examples)
- stores it in a vector
- asks them until you know it well

## why it's better than the others?
